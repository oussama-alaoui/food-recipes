Be careful not to overwork the dough as you will make the pastry tough, and it’s likely to shrink more when cooked. Tip the dough onto a lightly floured work surface and lightly knead until smooth and uniform in colour. Wrap in cling film and chill until needed. ', 'To make the caramelised white chocolate, heat oven to 120C/100C fan/gas ½. Put the chocolate on a large baking tray and bake for 45 mins-1 hr, giving it a good stir every 10 mins, until it’s a light golden brown – almost the colour of peanut butter. After 45 mins or so, the chocolate may start to look chalky or seized, but should become smooth again after a good stir. If not, don’t worry, as it will be melted again in the next stage. Scrape the chocolate into a bowl, cover and set aside. ', 'For the bavarois, pour the milk into a medium saucepan and bring to the boil. Meanwhile, put the egg yolks and sugar in a bowl and whisk together. Put the gelatine in a small bowl of cold water and leave to soften for 3-5 mins. Once the milk has come to the boil, pour onto the egg mixture while whisking quickly together to prevent the eggs scrambling. Pour back into the pan and cook, stirring constantly, until the custard thickens (if you have an instant-read thermometer, it should be 75-80C). Pour the custard into a bowl and add 150g of the caramelised chocolate and the gelatine (squeezing out the water), stirring until both have melted. Sieve through a fine mesh sieve to remove any lumps from the chocolate. Cover the bowl with cling film and chill until the custard has cooled and started to set around the side of the bowl – but don’t leave for too long or it will set completely. Whip the cream until it holds soft peaks and carefully fold this through the custard until smooth and fully combined. Pour the mixture into the holes of your silicone dome mould and carefully place in the freezer until frozen solid (best left overnight). ', 'Now bake your tart cases. Remove the pastry from the fridge and allow to soften slightly for 15 mins before rolling out until it is around 2mm thick. Cut out rounds of pastry just larger than the 6 tartlet cases and use to carefully line. Place the lined cases onto a parchment-lined baking tray and chill in the fridge or freezer until the pastry is firm. Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Line the tarts with a piece of parchment and fill with baking beans or rice. Bake the tarts for 20 mins, then remove the parchment and beans, and bake for a further 5-10 mins until the bases of the tarts start to brown. Allow the tarts to cool fully. ', 'For the ginger macadamia caramel, put the cream and ginger in a small saucepan and bring to the boil. Remove the pan from the heat and cover with a lid, allowing the ginger to infuse into the cream for 1 hr. Strain the cream through a fine mesh sieve into a measuring jug, topping back up to 120ml if needed. Put the sugar in a medium saucepan over a medium heat and cook until the sugar has melted and caramelised, swirling but not stirring, until it is a dark caramel colour. Pour in half the cream – be careful as this mixture will bubble up violently. Once the caramel has settled, add in the remaining cream, stirring over the heat if any lumps have formed. Add the butter and ¾ of the nuts, and stir to combine. Once the caramel has cooled slightly, divide it between the tart shells. ', 'For the glaze, put the remaining 225g of caramelised white chocolate in a bowl. Pour the cream into a saucepan and bring to the boil, then pour over the chocolate, stirring until you have a smooth, pourable glaze. Remove the bavarois domes from the freezer and carefully unmould, placing them on a wire rack set over a baking tray. While the glaze is still warm and fluid, pour over the domes, making sure the entire surface is covered. Using a small palette knife, lift the domes from the rack and carefully place on top of the tarts. ', 'To decorate, chop the remaining nuts so they are fairly fine, then press around the base of the domes where they sit on the tarts. Chill for 30 mins (or up to 24 hrs) to allow the bavarois to defrost before serving.']"

Increase heat and bubble, swirling the pan from time to time, until the caramel turns a gorgeous amber colour – but don’t stir as this will cause the caramel to crystallise. Remove the pan from the heat and allow the caramel to cool and thicken to the consistency of golden syrup – if it sets too solid, simply place it over a low heat to melt again. ', 'Use a cocktail stick or wooden skewer to push into each hazelnut – make sure that you don’t push it in where the seam is or the hazelnut will split. Place a sheet of baking parchment on the floor directly underneath your work surface – this will catch any drops of caramel. Dredge the hazelnut through the thickened caramel, coating it very generously indeed. Secure the cocktail stick to the work surface with some sticky tape or wedge under a heavy pan, so that the caramel covered hazelnut hangs over the edge. Allow the caramel to drip, like a stalactite, towards the floor and set hard. Repeat with all the hazelnuts and allow the caramel to set. When hardened, use scissors to gently trim the fine threads of caramel off the more robust, decorative spikes. Arrange the hazelnuts, spikes pointing up, in the centre of the cake.']"

You’ll need to make 3 rectangular chocolate sponges, a pair of round chocolate sponges, and 3 rectangular orange sponges to assemble this cake, so get everything organised first. Take a look at our Guide and the additional tips, in the Tip box below. ', 'For every rectangular sponge, you’ll need to line the base of a 21 x 31cm tin (see Guide in the Tips below and Related guides box, right) neatly with baking parchment and grease the sides with a little flavourless oil. ', 'Start with the chocolate sponges. Put the butter in a small saucepan and heat gently until melted. Whisk together the egg yolks, milk and vanilla extract in a small bowl. Stir the flour and cocoa into the melted butter to make a paste. Transfer this butter-flour mixture to a big mixing bowl and whisk in the egg mixture a little at a time – this takes elbow grease to get it smooth, but keep going! ', 'Put the egg whites in a bowl and beat with an electric whisk until stiff. Add the sugar and continue beating until the mixture is glossy and thick. Whisk a third of the meringue mixture into the chocolate mixture to loosen, then use a big metal spoon to gently fold the remaining meringue into the batter until just incorporated. Spread the batter evenly in the tin. Bake for 12 mins. ', 'Turn the cake out of the tin onto baking parchment very lightly dusted with icing sugar. Peel off the cake lining parchment and cover with a clean tea towel. ', 'Repeat steps 2 to 5 twice more. When the third rectangular sponge is baked, turn out as before but very loosely roll up the sponge like a Swiss roll, starting from one of the shortest sides, rolling up the tea towel inside. ', 'Make a final, fourth batch of the chocolate sponge recipe, but this time divide it between 2 x 20cm round, shallow sandwich tins. Bake for 10 mins, then turn out as instructed in step 5. ', 'Now make the orange sponges. Follow steps 3 to 6 again, but instead of milk, measure 75ml of the juice from the orange you’ve zested. If you don’t have enough, make up the difference with milk. Whisk in the zest. ', 'Cool all the sponges. ', 'Making the frosting and icing: For the orange frosting, beat together the butter, icing sugar, orange zest and juice. Beat until just combined – the acidity of the orange may start to split the mixture if overbeaten. If it looks a little split though, don’t worry – just stop mixing, it’ll still taste lovely. Can be kept in the fridge for up to 3 days, but will need bringing back to room temp to use. ', 'When you are about to start assembling, put all the chocolate icing ingredients in a heatproof bowl over a pan of barely simmering water. Gently melt together, stirring occasionally, until smooth and shiny. ', 'Assembling the cake: Cut each rectangular sponge into 2 long strips 7cm wide – trimming the long edges off will give you a neater finish (see step A in the Guide). It’s important to be really accurate, so use a ruler. Trim the short edges to neaten. When you prepare the rolled-up sponges, just gently unroll first – don’t worry if they crack a bit. ', 'Spread a thin layer of orange frosting over every strip, right to the edges. Gently peel the strips away from their paper – they will have stuck a bit. Start with 1 chocolate and 1 orange strip that was rolled up to cool, and lay one on top of the other – but don’t line up the ends. Sit the second sponge about an inch down from one of the ends of the bottom sponge (it doesn’t matter which is chocolate and which is orange). Start to roll up from this end – the bottom sponge should roll up and over neatly on top of the second, so the middle of the roll is nice and tight (see step A in the Guide). ', 'Keep adding extra sponges and rolling up to make a giant Swiss roll but as you roll, the ends of each different-coloured layer won’t finish together (and this difference increases as the roll gets bigger). So you’ll need to add chocolate and orange sponges individually from now on, rather than sandwiching together first, then adding to the rolled cake. Where each strip ends, you’ll stick on a matching sponge – so a chocolate strip always continues with another chocolate, and the same with orange (see steps C & D in the Guide). This is the fiddly bit, as you’ll find you’ll need to partly stick on 1 coloured strip, then snuggle in the other coloured strip partway through. (This sounds more complicated than it is. When you start to do it, this will all make sense.) If you have a spare pair of hands in the house, this is the time to use them. ', 'It’s up to you whether you find it easier to work as a roll (see step E in the Guide), or to turn the roll on one of its flat ends to work with (see step F in the Guide). I started rolling, and just as it got towards the ends and was getting quite heavy and bulky, I flipped it to continue. Have the round sponges to hand as you near the end, to check whether you’ve reached a roll of 20cm diameter plus. As soon as you do, stop – you may have 1 strip of 1 colour left over. ', 'Sit the rolled cake on one of its flat ends if you haven’t already. Spread a good layer of orange frosting over the top, then press on 1 of the round chocolate sponges (see step G in the Guide) – line it up to the middle of the roll, rather than one of the edges of the roll. This means you’ll have to take a sharp knife and trim the roll all around, until it is perfectly flush with the round sponge top. Flip the cake upside down onto your serving plate. Spread some more orange frosting over the new top, and add the second round sponge. ', 'Gradually spoon on, and spread over, the chocolate icing with a big palette knife. If should still be runny enough to gently run down the sides, giving you a shiny finish (see step H in the Guide).']"
